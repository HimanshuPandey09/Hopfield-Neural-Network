# Hopfield-Neural-Network
Hopfield NN for few English characters with 25 neurons. Energy and hamming distance used for learning
Training is done in python.
This python file creates weight matrix and weights for individual neurons in 8.8 signed binary format.
Distorted inputs are created by another python file wich generates 1x25 vector which is also converted into 8.8 signed binary format.
these weights and testing files need to be imported into vivado for H/W implimentation.
